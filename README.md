# -Brain-Wave-Technology-in-vehicles
- Brain wave technology in vehicles will help an individual to prevent accidents, helps to detect the locations of cars, and helps not to lose the car. - Each user has a personal account in which the brainwaves of the car driver is stored, and 3 more people can get added which will help to compare the brainwaves of normal mode and driving mode from which the EEG sensor on the steering will give warnings and eventually the engine will off if any suspicious activity is found. - The project was done till design then handed to the mechanical department to implement. - The overall accuracy of the simulation was 87%.
