This project “Brainwave technology in vehicles” provides facilities like preventing hijacking, detecting physical conditions of drivers, and accident detection.
Everyone’s brain produces a distinctive pattern of alpha-beta waves something like neural fingerprints that can be applied for the security of vehicles needing high safety. Vehicles are provided a biometric system, in which the driver would be scanned with an EEG and the pattern is stored. If the patterns don’t match the vehicle resists starting.
The changing mental conditions of the driver would affect brain waves thus detecting physically not fit conditions and not allowing continuing driving.
The proposed system transmits an emergency signal derived from the driver’s brain wave to the earth station via a GPS satellite, in a critical condition after the accident.
